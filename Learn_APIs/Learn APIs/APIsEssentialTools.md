# Tools For The API Development



# 1. 
## Curl
- HTTP calls from command line

```
1. Get Request
curl https://postman-echo.com/get?project=Name

To use curl, simply open your PowerShell in Windows or the terminal and Linux or macOS, type curl and hit "Enter". Curl makes it easy to send HTTP GET requests. For example, simply add the API URI after curl. This command sends a HTTP GET request to Postman Echo, a service from Postman to display the headers and request body sent to it. 

- Useful for testing the api calls

2. POST Requests

curl -d "project=NameProject" -X POST https://postman-echo.com/post
```
#
## Postman

```
The second tool is Postman, which has cross-platform desktop tools that make it easy to test and debug APIs. With an advanced graphical interface and a web version, Postman is a powerful tool for API development.

#
## Insomnia

```
A Important tool is the Insomnia REST Client, a powerful REST API client used to store, organize, and execute REST API requests.
Insomnia is free, cross-platform, and comes with a very user-friendly interface.
